#WDI Installfest 

We are going to install most of the tools we'll use in this course onto your computer today. 

The tools and technologies we'll install fall into three categories, so we have three sets of instructions you should go through in order:

1. <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/installfest/blob/master/mac_dev_tools.md" target="_blank">basic tools for web development on Mac OS X</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/installfest/blob/master/express_stack.md" target="_blank">tools specific to our Node.js and Express development stack</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/installfest/blob/master/ruby_on_rails_stack.md" target="_blank">tools for our Ruby on Rails stack</a>

*In this context, "stack" just refers to a group of technologies used together to create a website.*

If you are unsure what to do or run into problems during installation, don't worry. Read any error messages, recheck the instructions, and get help.
