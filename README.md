Based on https://github.com/wdi-sf-july/installfest

## To Do

* test as many instructions as possible on clean computer
* split into multiple readmes so it's not crazy long / hard to read?
* check that Maverick Xcode/Command Line Tools instructions also apply for Yosemite
* completely replace Maverick suggestion with 'upgrade to yosemite'?
* copy over images from wdi-sf-july if wanted  
* add sublime and emmet

## Done

* included instructions for PostgreSQL
* included instructions for Node.js
* included instructions for MongoDB
* added a few notes on what things are / why installing
* completely removed ubuntu and windows instructions
```

#WDI Installfest 

We are going to install most of the tools we'll use in this course onto your computer. We'll install a set of basic tools for programming on OS X, a set of tools specific to our Node.js development stack, and a set for our Ruby on Rails stack.

*In this context, "stack" just refers to a group of technologies used together to create a website.*

If you are unsure or run into problems during installation, don't worry; we will finish up any of the loose ends on Installfest.
